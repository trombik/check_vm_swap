=head1 NAME

check_vm_swap - A Nagios plugin to check swap in/out operations

activities

=head1 SYNOPSIS

check_vm_swap --warning w --critical c [-v]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

check_vm_swap checks swap activities. it does B<NOT> check total amount
of available swap storage. As long as kernel has enough swap space, swapping
is not a problem. Mordern kernel rarely swap process. Even if it does, it's OK
if the swapped process is idling. However, many swapping activity is almost
always a problem. check_swap from Nagios plugins just checks how much swap
space is available and screams when swap is used. If swapped process has been
idle for a while and other processes need memory, it's okay. That's what kernel
is supposed to do. I needed a plugin to check how often kernel swap-in/out
process.

by default, it monitors how often kernel swaps in/out. paging in/out is also
supported.

=head2 OPTIONS

=over

=item --warning, -w, --critical, -c

per-five-minutes thresholds for swap operation.

=item --type TYPE

What VM activity to monitor, "swap" or "page", default is swap.

=item --statedir /path/to/directoy

Where state file is written (/var/spool/nagios/plugins). The user needs write
perimission.

=back

=head1 SEE ALSO

check_swap, if you B<really> want to monitor how much swap space left.
